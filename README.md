Drawing inspiration from Robby Leonardi, I created a video game-style interactive resume to capture my passion for art and technology. I started from scratch, coding the basic functionality of the The Dinosaur Game, developing the scene changes and character movement, and building my graphics into a story. This game takes you through my world, showcasing my journey through college and highlighting the bullet points of my resume and personality in a fun way.
